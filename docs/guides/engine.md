# Run Scripts With `Engine`

`Engine` is the RustTS runtime. It runs QuickJS on the thread that creates it:
calls between Rust and TypeScript are direct function calls with native value
conversion, with no message to another thread, no generated source and no JSON
text.

It fits the way a game or an application already works: its main loop, simulation
step or command handler calls into scripts when it needs them. RustTS spawns no
threads and has no event loop; nothing runs unless the host calls `Engine`.

[`examples/game_loop.rs`](https://github.com/Glubus/Rust-TS/blob/main/examples/game_loop.rs)
puts most of this page together in one frame loop: a [context group](#context-groups)
of two scripts, [timers](#timers), [events](#events), [requests](#requests), an async
host function resumed by [`pump`](#deferred-script-results), and a reload that
[keeps state](#keep-state-across-reloads). Run it with
`cargo run --example game_loop --features derive`.

## Load And Call

```rust
use rustts::{Engine, VmOptions};

let mut engine = Engine::new(&VmOptions::default())?;
engine
    .registry()
    .function::<FindUser>()?
    .callback::<UserFound>()?;

engine.load_script("rules", include_str!("rules.ts"))?;

let total: f64 = engine.call("rules", "score", (3, 4))?;
let report: Report = engine.call("rules", "report", (&input,))?;
engine.emit("user.found", &UserFoundPayload { user_id: 7 })?;
```

- Register host contracts before loading the scripts that use them: host functions
  are installed in a script when it loads.
- `call` takes its arguments as a tuple (`()` for none), a `Vec` or a slice of
  values implementing [`JsEncode`](type-mapping.md), and decodes the result with
  `JsDecode`. `engine.call::<serde_json::Value>(id, name, vec![json])` keeps a
  JSON-shaped API.
- Calling a script that is not loaded fails with `VmError::ScriptNotFound`; calling
  an export the script does not have fails with `VmError::FunctionNotFound`. An
  exception thrown by the script is returned as `VmError::Execution` with its
  message and stack, located in the TypeScript source (see
  [Error Locations](#error-locations)).

## Scripts And Projects

- `load_script(id, source)` loads one TypeScript source string. It may import the
  registered host modules, not other files.
- `load_project(id, entry_path)` loads a multi-file project from its entry file:
  the static ESM graph is resolved from disk (relative imports, `index` modules,
  `tsconfig.json` `paths` and `baseUrl`, packages in the project's
  `node_modules`, resolved as ESM: see
  [Supported Project Imports](load-scripts-and-projects.md#supported-project-imports)).
- Dynamic `import()` is rejected at load in both cases, with
  `dynamic import() is not supported; use a static import`.
- `unload_script(id)` removes a script and releases its modules, after running its
  `ctx.hot.dispose` callbacks (see [Keep State Across Reloads](#keep-state-across-reloads)).

Each script runs in its own QuickJS context, unless it is loaded into a
[context group](#context-groups): scripts do not share globals. A script can import
the registered host modules and its own modules, never another script's, in a group
or not. All scripts of one `Engine` share its QuickJS runtime, and so its memory
limit, stack limit and garbage collector. See
[Load Scripts And Projects](load-scripts-and-projects.md) for details.

## Events

`emit(event, &payload)` delivers the payload to every handler registered with
`ctx.on(event, handler)`, script by script in load order, and returns how many
scripts had at least one handler.

- The payload is encoded once per script that has handlers, and shared by all of
  that script's handlers.
- A reload keeps the script's place in the delivery order.
- A handler that throws does not stop the others: every handler runs, then `emit`
  returns the first error. An exhausted [execution budget](#execution-budget) or an
  interrupt does stop it: delivery ends at the handler that hit it, and later
  handlers do not run. The same holds for `request`.
- `ctx.off(event, handler)` removes the first registration of `handler`. A delivery
  already in progress still runs it. A script whose last handler for an event is
  removed is no longer entered for that event.

### Per-Frame Data

Delivering an event costs about 100 ns per script on top of the handler itself,
but building its payload costs more: every Rust struct becomes a new JavaScript
object, a few hundred nanoseconds for a small one. For data sent every frame:

- Send one event per frame carrying everything (`{ notes, inputs, judgments }`)
  rather than one event per item, when handlers can take it that way.
- Send bulk numeric data as columns of [`NativeBytes`](native-bytes.md) instead of
  a list of structs: one copy per column instead of one object per item. Scripts
  read them through typed arrays (`new Float64Array(bytes.buffer, bytes.byteOffset,
  count)`).

## Requests

`request(event, &payload)` delivers an event like `emit` and returns what each
handler returned, as `Vec<(&str, R)>` pairs of script id and reply, in delivery
order:

```rust
let labels: Vec<(&str, String)> = engine.request("menu.label", "save")?;
```

```ts
ctx.on("menu.label", item => `Save ${item}`);
```

- An `async` handler's Promise is awaited: its reply is what it resolves to.
- Every handler runs even after one fails (a throw, a rejection, a reply that does
  not decode as `R`); `request` then returns the first error.
- Register the event with `request::<T>()`, where `T` implements
  [`HostRequest`](register-host-functions.md#declare-a-request), so the generated
  TypeScript requires handlers to return the reply type.

## Promises

`Engine` has no event loop, so it runs Promise jobs itself: the jobs a load, call,
emit, request or timer run queues (`then` callbacks, `await` continuations,
`queueMicrotask`) run before it returns, within the same execution budget.

- `call` on an `async` export returns the resolved value, or fails with the
  rejection reason; so does a `request` handler.
- A Promise that no script job can settle, such as one waiting on a timer or
  host resolver, fails a synchronous `call` or `request`. Use the explicit
  deferred variants to wait across frames. An event handler or timer callback
  can wait: its continuation runs when the timer fires or `pump` delivers the
  host response.
- A Promise rejection that no handler caught by the end of the operation fails it
  with `unhandled promise rejection: …`, as Node does. Attach a `catch` to promises
  you do not await.

## Deferred Script Results

`call` and `request` still wait for their returned Promises using the jobs available
in that operation. If the script awaits a timer or a host reply that will arrive in
a later frame, use `call_deferred` or `request_deferred` instead. Their `PendingCall`
returns `None` from `take()` while the script waits, then yields its result once.
Neither `take()` nor `is_finished()` executes JavaScript. For example:

```rust
let beat = engine.call_deferred::<f64>("chart", "nextBeat", ())?;
engine.advance_timers(std::time::Duration::from_millis(16))?;
engine.pump()?; // deliver queued host replies; does not move the timer clock
if let Some(result) = beat.take() {
    println!("beat: {}", result?);
}
```

`request_deferred` returns owned `(ScriptId, reply)` pairs in script load and handler
registration order even when answers arrive in another order. A handler error is
returned through the handle once all replies finish; other handlers still run.
If a participating script is replaced or unloaded while the request is pending,
the request yields `VmError::Cancelled` instead of mixing versions. A failed
reload leaves old tasks running; a successful reload cancels them, including late
host replies. `ctx.hot` transfers opted-in data, not suspended async stacks.

`pump()` delivers host replies and drains queued Promise jobs under one budget.
The host chooses when to call it; resolving a `HostResolver` from another thread
only enqueues a value and never runs JavaScript there. `advance_timers` is still
the only thing that advances script timers.

## Timers

Scripts get `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval`. Their
clock is the engine's own, starting at 0, and only `advance_timers(elapsed)` moves
it, so timers are deterministic: call it from your loop, typically once per frame.

```rust
engine.advance_timers(frame_time)?;
```

```ts
const sleep = (ms: number) => new Promise<void>(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
ctx.on("round.start", async () => {
  await sleep(3000);
  hud.show("Go!");
});
```

- Due timers fire script by script in load order, each script's in due order, then
  in creation order; `advance_timers` returns how many scripts had timers to fire
  and enters no other script.
- A timer fires at most once per call: one set from a callback waits for the next
  call even with a zero delay, and an interval several periods late fires once,
  its next due time staying its previous one plus its delay.
- A throwing callback does not stop the others; the first error is returned. An
  exhausted [execution budget](#execution-budget) or an interrupt does: firing ends
  at the timer that hit it, and the timers of the scripts not reached yet stay due
  for the next `advance_timers`.
- Timers belong to the script version that set them: a reload or unload drops
  them. Restart them from the new version, with `ctx.hot` for their state.
- The callback must be a function; a string of code is rejected.

## Console

`console.debug`, `log`, `info`, `warn` and `error` join their arguments with
spaces (strings as they are, other values as JSON when they have one, errors with
their stack) and hand the message to the engine's console sink. By default it
writes `[level] script: message` lines to stderr; `set_console` routes it, for
every script, to your own logger:

```rust
engine.set_console(|level, script_id, message| {
    game_log.write(level, script_id, message);
});
```

Stack locations in logged errors point at the TypeScript source, as in
[Error Locations](#error-locations).

## Error Locations

Errors point at the TypeScript you wrote. Each script frame of a
`VmError::Execution` stack names its file and its TypeScript line and column:

```text
javascript execution failed: division by zero
    at divide (lib/math.ts:8:15)
    at run (main.ts:7:17)
```

- A project module is named by its path relative to the project root (the
  `tsconfig.json` directory, else the entry file's), with `/` separators; an inline
  script is `<id>.ts`.
- Lines and columns start at 1; columns count UTF-16 code units, as editors and
  `tsc` do. A frame points where QuickJS places it: the callee or the last argument
  of a call, the object of a failed property access.
- Errors from top-level code during a load, calls, `async` exports, event and
  request handlers, timer callbacks, Promise jobs and unhandled rejections are all
  located. Frames outside script modules, such as `native` ones, stay as they are.
- A syntax error fails the load with `VmError::Transpile`, one diagnostic per line
  as `path:line:column: message`, followed by its labels and help, indented.
- Each module's source map is built when it is transpiled, kept with it in memory
  and in the disk cache, and only read when an error is reported: successful calls
  and emits do no extra work.

## Reaching Host Functions From Scripts

A script reaches every registered host function in three ways, all ending in the
same native function:

- ESM import of the contract's module: `import { user } from "app";` (see
  [`IMPORT_MODULE`](generate-sdk-files.md#import-modules))
- the namespaced global, without an import: `user.find({ userId: 7 })`
- the generated SDK (`registry().sdk()`), which calls `__host.callValue`; an inline
  script can include the SDK source followed by its own code, and a project can
  import the generated SDK file

## Reload

Loading a script or project again with the same id replaces it. The new version is
transpiled, resolved and initialized first; if any of that fails (syntax error,
resolution error, exception or timeout in top-level code), the previous version
stays loaded. A successful reload starts from fresh script state, except for what
the script hands over through `ctx.hot` (see
[Keep State Across Reloads](#keep-state-across-reloads)).

## Hot Reload

`reload_changed()` reloads every project whose files changed since it was loaded,
in load order, and returns a `ReloadReport` with the reloaded ids, the failed ones,
and the reloaded ones whose previous version's `ctx.hot.dispose` threw. Call it from
your loop; it starts no thread:

```rust
// For example once per second during development.
let report = engine.reload_changed();
for (id, error) in &report.failed {
    eprintln!("{id} kept its previous version: {error}");
}
for (id, error) in &report.dispose_failed {
    eprintln!("{id} reloaded, but its previous version failed to clean up: {error}");
}
```

- A project is checked through the size and modification time of its module
  files, the directories from each module up to the project root, its
  `tsconfig.json` and the configs that one `extends` through a relative or absolute
  path (not configs from packages), and the `package.json` files its imports
  resolved through. When nothing changed, the check reads no file.
- A reload only reads, parses and transpiles the modules whose files changed. While
  no file was added or removed and `tsconfig.json` / `package.json` are unchanged,
  the imports of unchanged modules are not resolved again either.
- A failed reload keeps the previous version running and is reported once; the
  project is retried after its next change, to the previous version's files or to
  those the failed reload reached (a module it newly imported, say).
- Inline scripts (`load_script`) have no files and are never reloaded here.
- Changes outside the watched paths (for example a new file in a `paths` fallback
  directory that holds no loaded module) need an explicit `load_project`.

### Keep State Across Reloads

A reload starts the script from fresh module state. To keep some of it, the script
hands it over through `ctx.hot`, which the generated declarations and SDK type:

```ts
type Saved = { score: number };

let score = (ctx.hot.data as Saved | undefined)?.score ?? 0;
const timer = scheduler.every(1000, "tick");

ctx.hot.save(() => ({ score }));
ctx.hot.dispose(() => scheduler.cancel(timer));

export function add(points: number): number {
  return (score += points);
}
```

- `ctx.hot.data` is the value the previous version's `save` callback returned. It
  is set before any of the new version's code runs, so top-level code can read it;
  it is `undefined` on a first load, after `unload_script` and when the previous
  version registered no `save`.
- `ctx.hot.save(fn)` registers the callback run on the old version when a reload
  replaces it. It runs before the new version loads, so it must only read state:
  if the new version then fails to load, the old one keeps running as if nothing
  happened. The last registration wins. A `save` that throws fails the reload, and
  the old version keeps running.
- `ctx.hot.dispose(fn)` registers a cleanup run on the old version only once the
  new version has loaded, and by `unload_script`. Every registered cleanup runs, in
  registration order, even after one throws. A reload whose new version fails to
  load does not dispose the old one.
- A throwing `dispose` does not undo the reload: the new version stays loaded and
  the load call (`load_script`, `load_project`) returns `VmError::Execution` saying
  the previous version's `ctx.hot.dispose` failed and the new version is loaded.
  `reload_changed` lists that script both in `reloaded` and in `dispose_failed`.
  `unload_script` returns the error too, and the script is unloaded all the same.
- `save` and `dispose` run under the execution budget, with their Promise jobs,
  like a call. They are synchronous: a Promise returned by `save` becomes
  `ctx.hot.data` as is.
- Scripts share one QuickJS runtime, so `data` is the very object `save` returned,
  not a copy: nothing is serialized. Prefer plain data (objects, arrays, numbers,
  strings). A function or class instance from the old version keeps the old
  version's context in memory while it is referenced, and `instanceof` against the
  new version's classes is false for it.
- Dropping the `Engine` runs no `dispose` callback.

## Execution Budget

Every load, call, emit, request, deferred call or request, `pump`, and
`advance_timers` runs under `VmOptions::execution_timeout` (5 seconds by
default). The budget starts when the operation first reaches a QuickJS check or a
Rust host function, so time spent in host functions counts against it and an
operation that reaches neither (a short handler) never reads the clock; suspended
time between host calls does not count. QuickJS
checks about every ten thousand interpreter steps: JavaScript still running at
the first check after expiry is interrupted with `VmError::Execution`. The
budget is cooperative: it cannot preempt a blocked Rust function, and JavaScript
that finishes before the next check is not stopped. A synchronous loop cannot
be paused and resumed: interruption aborts it.

To stop a script earlier, for example from a UI "stop" button or a watchdog thread,
take an `InterruptHandle` before handing work to the engine's thread. It is `Send`
and `Clone`:

```rust
let handle = engine.interrupt_handle();
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
    handle.interrupt();
});
// Fails with VmError::Interrupted if still running after 200 ms.
let result = engine.call::<()>("rules", "simulate", ());
```

`interrupt` stops the operation in progress (load, call, emit, request or
`advance_timers`); the engine stays usable. A request made while nothing runs has
no effect on the next operation. An `emit`, `request` or `advance_timers` stops at
the handler or timer the interrupt or the exhausted budget reached; later ones do
not run. An interrupt that reaches a `ctx.hot.save` or `ctx.hot.dispose` callback
is reported as `VmError::Interrupted` by the load or `unload_script` that ran it.

## Transpilation Cache

`VmOptions::cache_dir` is `None` by default: every load transpiles the TypeScript
in memory. Set it to a directory to keep the transpiled JavaScript and its source
map on disk and reuse them across reloads and runs:

```rust
use rustts::{Engine, VmOptions};

let engine = Engine::new(&VmOptions {
    cache_dir: Some("target/rustts-cache".into()),
    ..VmOptions::default()
})?;
```

The directory is created if it does not exist. The cache holds one artifact per
module, keyed by the module source, its file extension, and the compiler and crate
versions: two projects sharing a file share its artifact, and editing one file of a
project transpiles that file only. Import resolution is never cached on disk. In
memory, loading a project again reuses its resolver and resolutions while the
watched structure (directories, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, registered host
modules) is unchanged: an unchanged module is neither read, parsed nor resolved
again. See [Runtime Guarantees](runtime-guarantees.md#transpilation-cache) for
integrity and atomic writes.

Nothing ever removes an artifact: the cache grows with every distinct version of
every module (and with each compiler or crate upgrade). Delete the directory to
reclaim the space; the next loads rebuild what they need.

Cache I/O never fails a load: an artifact that cannot be read is a miss, and one
that cannot be written (full disk, read-only directory) is skipped. Only creating
the directory, in `Engine::new`, can fail.

Independently of the disk cache, an `Engine` remembers in memory the transpiled
modules of its loaded scripts, so reloads within one run never transpile an
unchanged module.

## Memory

`memory_stats()` returns the QuickJS counters for the whole engine as a
`MemoryStats`: allocated bytes (`malloc_size_bytes`), the limit
(`malloc_limit_bytes`, from `VmOptions::memory_limit_bytes`), bytes used by live
values (`memory_used_bytes`), and allocation, atom, string, object and function
counts. A call that exceeds the memory limit fails, and the engine stays usable.

Each loaded script owns a QuickJS context, about 65 to 85 KiB with every built-in on
(measured on an empty script), so the default 16 MiB limit holds roughly 200 scripts:
raise `memory_limit_bytes` for more. A load that hits the limit fails with an error
saying so (`out of memory: ... memory_limit_bytes`) and keeps the scripts already
loaded.

### Script Built-ins

Creating a context is the main cost of loading a script. By default a context has
every QuickJS built-in; `VmOptions::builtins` (`ScriptBuiltins`) turns off the
optional ones a game's scripts do not use: `RegExp`, `Date`, `Proxy`, typed arrays,
`WeakRef` and `FinalizationRegistry`, and `atob`, `btoa` and `performance`.

```rust
use rustts::{ScriptBuiltins, VmOptions};

let options = VmOptions {
    // Scripts parse no text and keep no clock: they get the cheapest context.
    builtins: ScriptBuiltins::NONE,
    ..VmOptions::default()
};
// Or keep what the scripts use.
let options = VmOptions {
    builtins: ScriptBuiltins { regexp: true, ..ScriptBuiltins::NONE },
    ..VmOptions::default()
};
```

`ScriptBuiltins::NONE` creates a context in roughly half the time and a quarter less
memory (on a loaded laptop, an empty script loaded in about 480 to 590 µs instead of
660 to 960 µs, and 66 instead of 86 KiB). The core language, `JSON`, `Map`, `Set` and
`Promise` stay on, and so do `ctx`, `console` and the timers. A script that uses a
disabled built-in fails with a `ReferenceError` where it runs, never at load, so test
your scripts with the options you ship. Keep `typed_arrays` on when host functions use
`NativeBytes`.

### Context Groups

A script loaded with `load_script` or `load_project` gets a QuickJS context of its own:
nothing it does to the built-ins or the global object reaches another script. A context
is the main cost of a script: about 80 KiB, and with hundreds of them each event
delivery gets slower per script (every context touched is another heap in the cache).
`load_script_in(group, id, source)` and `load_project_in(group, id, entry)` load scripts
that trust each other into one shared context instead, one per group name:

```rust
engine.load_script_in("ui-pack", "menu", MENU_SOURCE)?;
engine.load_script_in("ui-pack", "hud", HUD_SOURCE)?;
engine.load_script("some-mod", MOD_SOURCE)?; // still a context of its own
```

A grouped script keeps its own events, timers, `console`, host-function identity
(`Caller::script_id()` is the script, not the group), `ctx.hot` state, unload and
reload; the context drops with the group's last script. What it loses is globals: a
shared context cannot hold one `ctx` or one `console` per script, so a grouped script
imports them:

```ts
import { ctx, console, setTimeout } from "rustts:env";
import { user } from "host-module"; // host functions come from host module imports
```

`rustts:env` works in a script with a context of its own too, so one source runs both
ways. A grouped script has none of `ctx`, `console`, the timers, `__host` or the
namespaced host globals (`user.find(...)`) as globals, which also means the generated
SDK file (which reads those globals) is not usable from a group, and a host function
whose contract has no `IMPORT_MODULE` cannot be reached. The generated declarations
type the module.

**A group is a trust boundary.** Its scripts share the built-ins and the global object:
one can patch `Array.prototype` or set `globalThis.x` for the others, and the scripts
of a group that follow one another in load order are handed one event object, encoded
once, so a handler that mutates it is seen by the next script's. Delivery order is the
load order whatever the groups: a group's scripts loaded one after another are served
in a single visit to the context, which is cheaper than alternating between contexts. Group the scripts of one author;
mods of different authors belong in different groups or in contexts of their own.
`Engine::load_script_in` does not freeze anything. Reloading a script of a group leaves
its previous modules in the group's context until the context drops (a context of its
own is dropped with the script), so reloading one script many times grows memory slowly.

What it buys, measured with `cargo bench --bench runtime --features derive -- 'load_many_scripts|emit'`
on an otherwise idle Windows development machine, groups of 10 scripts loaded one after
another: loading 400 scripts took 32 ms instead of 164 ms, and delivering a `{ dt, tick }`
event to a one-line handler in every script took 19 µs for 250 scripts instead of 84 µs,
52 µs for 500 instead of 208 µs and 128 µs for 1000 instead of 565 µs. The gap is the cost of building
the event in each context: every context has its own object shapes, which a shared
context reuses. Scripts of a group loaded
between scripts of other groups are served one visit per run, so load a group's scripts
together.

### Garbage Collection

QuickJS frees a value as soon as nothing references it. Only objects that reference
each other in a cycle (`a.b = b; b.a = a`, or a closure stored on the object it
captures) wait for the cycle collector, which QuickJS runs on its own when a script
creates an object past a memory threshold. A collection visits every live object
of the engine, so its pause grows with the whole heap, not with the garbage: on the
development machine, 50 scripts holding 2,000 objects each (18 MiB) paused one
`emit` for about 50 ms. At a high frame rate that is dozens of frames.

The engine's own calls, emits, requests, deferred completions and timers leave no
cycles behind: only cycles your scripts create need collecting. For time-critical
stretches:

```rust
engine.set_gc_threshold(None); // song starts: no automatic collection
// ... frames ...
engine.run_gc();               // results screen: collect now
engine.set_gc_threshold(Some(256 * 1024));
```

- `set_gc_threshold(None)` turns automatic collection off; `Some(bytes)` sets the
  threshold (256 KiB by default). After each automatic collection QuickJS moves it
  to 1.5 times the memory still in use.
- While it is off, cycles accumulate: watch `memory_stats()`. Reaching
  `VmOptions::memory_limit_bytes` fails the operation that allocates.
- Scripts that avoid creating cycles every frame never need collecting mid-song.

## Threading

`Engine` cannot be sent to another thread: it lives on the thread that created it,
and so do its scripts. To use scripts from several threads, own the engine on one
dedicated thread and send it work over a channel:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

use rustts::{Engine, VmError, VmOptions};

type Job = Box<dyn FnOnce(&mut Engine) + Send>;

let (jobs, inbox) = mpsc::channel::<Job>();
thread::spawn(move || {
    let mut engine = Engine::new(&VmOptions::default()).expect("create engine");
    for job in inbox {
        job(&mut engine);
    }
});

let (reply, answer) = mpsc::channel::<Result<f64, VmError>>();
jobs.send(Box::new(move |engine| {
    let _ = reply.send(engine.call("rules", "score", (3, 4)));
}))
.expect("script thread is running");
let total = answer.recv().expect("script thread replied")?;
```

## Performance

### Release builds without QuickJS assertions

QuickJS keeps about 250 internal assertions on, even in a release build. The
`disable-assertions` feature builds it without them:

```toml
rustts = { version = "0.4", features = ["disable-assertions"] }
```

On a loaded development machine it made a call-heavy script (`fib(20)`) about 23 %
faster (1.07 to 0.82 ms), a script making 1000 host calls about 11 % (154 to 137 µs)
and delivering an event to one handler about 10 % (402 to 362 ns). Host calls and
events gain less because most of their time is in the engine, not in QuickJS.

The assertions are also what turns a JavaScript value your Rust code leaked (a `Value`
or `Persistent` kept past the engine) into an abort when the engine drops; without them
the leak is silent. Keep the assertions in debug builds and in CI, and turn the feature
on for the builds you ship.

`cargo bench --bench vs_lua` runs the same workloads on mlua (Lua 5.4), QuickJS
called directly through rquickjs, and `Engine`. Criterion estimates from one run on an
otherwise idle Windows development machine, rquickjs 0.14, default features (QuickJS
assertions on):

| Workload | mlua | QuickJS direct | `Engine` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Call `sum(a, b)` | 52 ns | 96 ns | 83 ns |
| Call with a 20-field object in and out | 4.44 µs | 3.72 µs | 3.93 µs |
| One call making 1,000 host calls | 35.4 µs | 90.6 µs | 78.9 µs |
| Pure compute, `fib(20)` | 427 µs | 1.22 ms | 1.09 ms |
| Event to one handler | 264 ns | 174 ns | 143 ns |
| Reload a small script | 11.2 µs | 112 µs | 326 µs |

QuickJS itself is about 3× slower than Lua on pure compute. `Engine` calls with
numbers and events take raw-value fast paths that the direct rquickjs code in the
bench does not, so they come out ahead of it. The direct QuickJS reload only creates a
context and evaluates JavaScript; the `Engine` reload loads a changed TypeScript source
(two variants alternate) with the default options, without a disk cache.
Run `cargo run --release --example native_roundtrip` for a quick check of the same
comparison.
