//! QuickJS types used by [`JsEncode`](crate::JsEncode), [`JsDecode`](crate::JsDecode)

//! Implement the codec traits with these paths rather than a direct `rquickjs`
//! dependency: they are always the exact version RustTS is built with, so two copies
//! of `rquickjs` can never meet in one signature.
