/// Single-thread RustTS engine.
///
/// The engine owns its QuickJS runtime and cannot leave the thread that created it.
/// Script exports are called directly, host functions are native QuickJS functions,
/// and values convert without JSON text.
///
/// Every load, call, emit, request and timer advance runs under
/// `VmOptions::execution_timeout`: JavaScript still running when it expires is
/// interrupted and the operation fails with `VmError::Execution`.
/// [`Engine::interrupt_handle`] stops it earlier from another thread. Both are
/// cooperative and cannot preempt a Rust host function.
///
/// Promise jobs an operation queues run before it returns, within the same budget.
/// A synchronous [`Engine::call`] or [`Engine::request`] waits for an `async` export
/// only while script jobs can settle it. For host or timer-driven work, use
/// [`Engine::call_deferred`] or [`Engine::request_deferred`] and drive continuations
/// with [`Engine::pump`] or [`Engine::advance_timers`]. Unhandled rejections fail
/// the operation; observed deferred rejections belong to their pending handle.
///
/// Scripts get `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval` on an
/// engine clock that only [`Engine::advance_timers`] moves, and a `console` whose
/// output goes to stderr unless [`Engine::set_console`] routes it elsewhere.
///
/// Replacing a loaded script, through [`Engine::load_script`], [`Engine::load_project`]
/// or [`Engine::reload_changed`], hands over the state the script opts to keep with
/// `ctx.hot`: the loaded version's `ctx.hot.save` callback runs first, and its result
/// is the new version's `ctx.hot.data` before any of its code runs. Once the new
/// version is loaded, the old version's `ctx.hot.dispose` callbacks run, in
/// registration order. A throwing `save` fails the load and keeps the old version; a
/// throwing `dispose` fails the load call although the new version stays loaded.
/// [`Engine::unload_script`] runs the `dispose` callbacks too; dropping the engine
/// does not.
